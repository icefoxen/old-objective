The internal string encoding for Song should all be UTF-8, and the library
functions should reflect this.  However, it isn't, and they don't, yet.  And I'll probably put it off forever unless I have reason to do otherwise, so if you need it, please bug me about it rather than blindly waiting for another version.

There are no assign-and-shift statements (ie <-<< and <->>) 'cause that's just too many damn arrows.  Requests may alter this.

Remember, you MUST end blocks with a ";".

You can NOT put more than one package in a single file.  It just won't work.  Mainly 'cause I'm lazy.  'Sides, the guiding philosophy is supposed to be Keep It Simple, Stupid.

The var-length arg should be at the END of any var-list, but the parser does NOT check for this yet.

The line-tracking in error reports is somewhat approximate.

I need to re-write the indent parser bit in Ocaml.  Later, since Python really IS better-suited to such string-wonking.
I need to fix having escape characters in strings.  It appears to work fine in characters.

I'm making no promises on any kind of source or binary compatability between versions.  By version 1.0 I should have it nailed down pretty firmly, but this isn't version 1.0.

I strongly advise against using ANY symbols in your program that start with an underscore (_).  The compiler uses symbols starting with an underscore for special values, ie _INDENT, _DEDENT, _file, _NONE, _UNKNOWN.  Underscores in the middle and end of a symbol is fine.

The lexer doesn't handle strings quite right.

I need to add built-in support for versioning, a la ObjC and D.  Later.  KISS.
